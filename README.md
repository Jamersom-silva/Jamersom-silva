## 👋 Hi, I'm Jamersom Silva

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Back-end**, and I enjoy building applications that make sense in the real world — well-structured, secure, and designed to actually work.

I have a solid foundation in **business logic and code organization**, while also having enough front-end skills to build complete solutions end to end.

I usually study the theory before implementing things, because I believe **well-written code comes from understanding, not from rushing**.  
I prefer to grow consistently, focusing on quality and clarity in everything I build.

> 💡 I take software development seriously and aim to be someone **reliable**, both in code and in process.
