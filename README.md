## 👋 Hi, I'm Jamersom Silva

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **Back-end**, and I enjoy building applications that make sense in the real world  well-structured, secure, and designed to actually work.
I build complete  applications, with well-structured APIs, clear business logic, and strong attention to code quality.

When an idea comes up, I usually turn it into a project and evolve it step by step until it becomes solid and reliable.

My main stack includes Node.js, Express, TypeScript, React, and Next.js. I also work with Django, Prisma, and SQL databases.

I have several pinned projects here on GitHub, such as Financefy, Flowro, and LaunchBox, which reflect how I learn and build software.
I have a solid foundation in **business logic and code organization**, while also having enough front-end skills to build complete solutions end to end.

I usually study the theory before implementing things, because I believe **well-written code comes from understanding, not from rushing**.  
I prefer to grow consistently, focusing on quality and clarity in everything I build.

> 💡 I take software development seriously and aim to be someone **reliable**, both in code and in process.
