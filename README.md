👋 Hi, I'm Jamersom Silva
I'm a Junior Mobile Developer with a strong focus on the Android Ecosystem. I enjoy building applications that make sense in the real world—well-structured, stable, and designed to provide a great user experience.

My main focus is on Kotlin and Modern Android Architecture, using tools like Jetpack to build native solutions. I also have hands-on experience with React Native and JavaScript, allowing me to bridge the gap between native and cross-platform development when needed.

Currently, I develop my projects and freelance solutions through Kore Mobile Solutions, where I turn ideas into solid, reliable software step by step.

I have a solid foundation in Software Engineering and Data Structures (maintaining a 9.3 GPA at Estácio), and I believe that well-written code comes from deep understanding, not from rushing. I take software development seriously and aim to be a reliable developer who delivers clean, testable logic using Git and Jest.

💡 My goal is to grow consistently, focusing on code quality and technical clarity in every mobile experience I build.

⭐ Always open to learning, collaborating, and growing as a developer.
